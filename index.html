          <h1>Sonic The Hedgehog</h1>
          <h3>
            Sonic the Hedgehog is a platform video game developed by Sonic
            Team and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis home video game
            console. The first game in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, it was
            released in North America in June 1991 and in PAL regions and Japan
            the following month. The game features Sonic the Hedgehog, who can
            run at supersonic speeds, setting out on a quest to defeat
            Dr. Robotnik, a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and
            seeks the powerful Chaos Emeralds. Sonic was originally created to
            overthrow Nintendo's monopoly on the video game market in the early
            1990's. The plan worked and forced compitition between the two
            companies, which allowed some amazing games to be created. Once true
            3D games started being created (1996), Sega abandoned the 2d sonic
            formula for twelve years in their mainline games. These 3d games are
            loved by many but serve as a point of criticism as to whether sonic
            is better in 2d or 3d.

            Journey is an indie adventure game co-developed by Thatgamecompany
            and Santa Monica Studio, published by Sony Computer Entertainment,
            and directed by Jenova Chen. It was initially released for the PS3
            in March 2012, and ported to the PS4 in July of 2015. The player controls
            a robed figure in a vast desert, traveling towards a mountain in the
            distance. Other players on the same journey can be discovered, and two
            players can meet and assist each other, but they can only communicate
            via musical chimes, and cannot see each other's names until after the
            game's credits. These chimes transform dull pieces of cloth found
            throughout the levels into vibrant red, affecting the game world and
            allowing the player to progress through the levels.

            of your certain death, but it is up to you to brave the darkness
            and keep the fire burning. Dark Souls’ fame has spawned many other
            similar titles from different developers, coining the term ‘Soulslike’.

            Terraria was released in 2011 by the small indie team Re-Logic. The
            games initial years were turbulent, with constant accusations of being
            a 2D Minecraft rip-off. The game’s turbulent development further
            drove away some of its audience. However, those who stuck with the
            game witnessed the game grow far past the criticisms. Terraria has
            since grown a notable cult following, expanding its gameplay and
            player base with each content update. Other 2D sandbox games have
            drawn inspiration from Terraria in its progression and overworld design.
